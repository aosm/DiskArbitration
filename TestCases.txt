Disk Arbitration and disktool test cases split by test area

Default Permissions = chown dev nodes and disks do not mount at loginwindow

Mounting
	Using Default Permissions At Loginwindow
		All fixed disks should be mounted
		Insert CD - shouldn't mount, though mountpoint is created and set
		Insert Multi Partition - shouldn't mount
		Insert disk that will fail fsck (ntfs) - error dialog without launch DU button & text
		Insert disk that is unrecognized (beos) - error dialog without init button & text
		under all cases above, /dev/disk* nodes should not be chowned, or left at zero
		under all cases above, disks should be hardware ejectable (and Pro keyboard)
		
		Insert CD (shouldn't mount) and login - CD should mount and be "owned" by logged in user

	Disk Images/Remote Mounts
		log in >console (or remote), mount a disk image, should mount and chown /dev to user uid
		log in >console (or remote), mount_afp/URLMount image, should mount
		log in, mount a disk image, should mount and chown /dev to user uid and display in finder

	Using Default Permissions After Logging In
		All fixed disks should be mounted and appear in finder
		Insert CD - should appear in finder
		Insert Audio CD - should appear in finder
		Insert multi partition - should mount multi volumes in Finder
		Insert disk that will fail fsck (ntfs) - error dialog with launch DU button & text
		Insert disk that is unrecognized (beos) - error dialog with init button & text
		under all cases above, /dev/disk* nodes should be chowned to the uid of the logged in user, or left at zero

	Not chowning /dev nodes on removable media
		Insert disk while logged in as user, /dev nodes should not be chowned (i.e. left as root, operator)
		
	Allowing disks to mount at loginwindow
		All fixed disks should be mounted
		Insert CD - should mount, only root will be able to eject without logging in
		Insert Multi Partition - should mount, only root will be able to eject without logging in
		When a user logs in, that user will be made "owner" of the disks and will be able to eject removable media


Permissions/Security
	
	using disktool the rules are,
		If the volume was mounted by a user, only that user or root should be able to eject it.
		Tests
			Mount a disk image at the command line by user test, only test or root should be able to eject
			Mount a CD while logged in as foo, bar should not be able to eject from command line, but foo can from command line or finder
			Same goes for unmount
			Same goes for rename
